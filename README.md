#Typed Pluto Rd Express 
Type Definitions for the [Pluto Rd Express backend](https://github.com/cantide5ga/pluto-rd-express).  

Both Pluto Rd Express backend and database middleware modules use the DAO type definition interfaces as contract.

*Normally this would be included in the project itself, but is seperated so as to avoid a circular dependency due to the nature of Pluto Rd backend plugin system.*
